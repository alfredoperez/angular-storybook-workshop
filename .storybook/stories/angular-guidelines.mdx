# Angular Guidelines

Here you will find guidelines for writing Angular components and services.

## Components

### Do not use services with state in presentational components

Presentational components should not have any dependencies on services. They should only receive data through inputs and emit events through outputs.

#### Do Not

```ts
export class ButtonComponent {
   state: inject(StateService)
}
```
